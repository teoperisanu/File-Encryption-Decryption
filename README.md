# File-Encryption-Decryption
File Encryption/Decryption in 32-bit x86 Assembly Language

This project encrypts or decrypts a file using two different algorithms. 
First algorithm: for each character will be computed two's complement and then the result will be rotated to the right with a given key.
The second algorithm: for each character will be computed ones' complement and then the XOR operation will be applied between the result and the given key. 
The decryption algorithms will be approch in reverse order to the specific encryption algorithm.
